# Piscine_CPP
## Project overview

This project was an introduction to C++. It covered the following concepts:

### [D00](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day00/CPP00.subject.pdf)

This first module is an introduction to the new concepts in C++ which are not present in C.

### [D01](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day01/CPP01.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in C++.


### [D02](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day02/CPP02.subject.pdf)
This module is designed to understand polymorphism ad-hoc, operator overloads and canonical classes in C++.

### [D03](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day03/CPP03.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand Inheritance in C++. 

### [D04](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day04/CPP04.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in C++. 

### [D05](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day05/CPP05.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in C++. 

### [D06](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day06/CPP06.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand the different casts in C++. 

### [D07](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day07/CPP07.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand templates in C++. 

### [D08](https://github.com/vportens/Piscine_CPP/blob/master/day08/CPP08.subject.pdf)

This module is designed to understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in C++.
